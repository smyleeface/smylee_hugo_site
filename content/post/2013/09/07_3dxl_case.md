<p>In March I started a personalized tote bag that was supposed to be used for an easter basket. I ran out of time and made a smaller simple unpersonalized easter bag.</p>    
<p><span style="line-height: 1.6em;">I wanted to make something for BG's birthday and still had the unfinished tote bag in the closet.</span></p>    
<p><img alt="BG letters on a bag from a prior project." src="http://cdn.smylee.com/images/2013/09/2013-BG-Birthday-01.jpg" title="The tote bag that didn&amp;#039;t quite work the way I wanted." /></p>    
<p><span style="line-height: 1.6em;">Not wanting to waste the fabric and the detail already made (initials and zipper pocket) I decided to chuck the tote bag and convert it into a 3DXL case.</span></p>    
<p><span style="line-height: 1.6em;">After measuring the 3DXL I found the inititals will spread across the whole case from edge to edge.</span></p>    
<p><img alt="BG cut out of the old bag and the rest of the fabric lying around." src="http://cdn.smylee.com/images/2013/09/2013-BG-Birthday-02.jpg" title="Started tearing apart the bag and cutting the pieces I needed." /></p>    
<p>I cut out the rest of the pieces and laid it out to get an idea of what I'm working with. This is where I stopped until I bought some black wide bias tape.</p>    
<p><img alt="Fabric pieces cut and laid out for sizing." src="http://cdn.smylee.com/images/2013/09/2013-BG-Birthday-03.jpg" title="I used my 3DXL to make sure it fit. At this point I didn&amp;#039;t have all the supplied I needed yet." /></p>    
<p>Now that I have the sizes sorted, I need to make the DS pocket. I wanted a little cushion, as it's holding precious content, so I put some batting between the fold as well as lightweight&nbsp;interfacing.</p>    
<p><img alt="Folded fabric showing the layers of interfacing and batting." src="http://cdn.smylee.com/images/2013/09/2013-BG-Birthday-04.jpg" title="Not really sure what I&amp;#039;m doing, just making it up as I go along..." /></p>    
<p>Now the pocket is finished, time to make the flap. I used lightweight interfacing on every inch of fabric (well, it was already on the tote.)</p>    
<p><img alt="The inside of the flap showing the interfacing." src="http://cdn.smylee.com/images/2013/09/2013-BG-Birthday-05.jpg" title="The inside of the flap that will never see the light of day again." /></p>    
<p>The velcro already existed on the tote bag.&nbsp;I reused both fabrics where&nbsp;the velcro was attached to.&nbsp;It was an accident but&nbsp;I liked the corners triangled off.</p>    
<p><img alt="The flap is turned right side out." src="http://cdn.smylee.com/images/2013/09/2013-BG-Birthday-06.jpg" title="Flap is pressed and ready to attach to the body of the case." /></p>    
<p>I skipped photographing all the steps of actually attaching the pockets and started back up again when I attached the zipper. My first attempt, I put the zipper on backwards (the zipper pull was on the inside.) In the&nbsp;second attempt, the left and right side of the zipper did not match&nbsp;so when it was zipped up, the top pulled right while the bottom pulled left.</p>    
<p><img alt="Open case stitched together with raw edges." src="http://cdn.smylee.com/images/2013/09/2013-BG-Birthday-07.jpg" title="MAGIC! It&amp;#039;s all assembled..." /></p>    
<p>Finally on my third, it came out just right. Luckily, each attempt was a basting stitch so it wasn't terribly hard to remove. I have put projects on hold because I don't feel like removing stitches.</p>    
<p><img alt="Close up of how close to the edge the stitch is on the zipper." src="http://cdn.smylee.com/images/2013/09/2013-BG-Birthday-08.jpg" title="It took three tries to get the zipper on correctly. And you know I HATE removing stitches." /></p>    
<p>Again no progress picture of the bias tape, but I did the initial stitch on the inside, so my handstitching ended up on the outside.&nbsp;</p>
