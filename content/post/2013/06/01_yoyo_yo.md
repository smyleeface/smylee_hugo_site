<p>After returning from DrupalCon with a novelty yo-yo, Raul turned around and bought me a real one. That novetly has nothing on my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Yomega-Maverick-High-Speed-Colors/dp/B001WOL09I" target="_blank">Maverick</a>.</p>    
<p>He even bought finger covers and a trick glove. The after one&nbsp;day of using it (~3 hours), my sholder and arm was sore for about three days. :[</p>

<p>I'm still practicing the sleeper, but it's fun to attempt some other tricks as so long as it doesn't hit my face (which hasn't happened just yet :x).</p>    
<p>I tell Raul that I do the slowest yo-yo tricks. Maybe I'll get a video up some day. In the meantime, here's an awesome photo taken by Ruben!</p>
