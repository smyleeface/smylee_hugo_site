<p>Spent some time on Palanai this past weekend. If you forget about all the zombies, it's actually really nice.</p>

<p>But there are zombies. Lots of them, and the just keep coming.</p>

<p>What's even worse? Getting your boat stuck and having to wade in the water to the next location. I'm still not sure but I hope it resets the boats when I exit the game. :|</p>

<p>This game didn't get the best reviews, but I really enjoy the series. I'm actually juggling two imported characters from part I. This game play is with Xian Mei at ~lvl 50. Can't wait to get back on!&nbsp;:crazy:</p>    <hr />  
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong></p>    
<p>MAAAAN!! I was super disappointed with the end of this game.</p>    
<p>[SPOILER ALERT]<br />  <span style="line-height: 1.6em;">In part I there's a time when you "leave the island" and you cannot return. After leaving the island, the game continues on for about 30 min or so until the final boss.<br />  In part II, there's also a time when you "leave the island", however, that concludes the game.&nbsp;*scratch_one-s_head*</span><br />  <span style="line-height: 1.6em;">[/SPOILER ALERT]</span></p>    
<p><span style="line-height: 1.6em;">I'd still go back and play it all over again though.&nbsp;*good*&nbsp;</span></p>
