<p>On Saturday we planted some beans and zucchini seeds in the backyard. I went out today and to my surprise they are sprouting!&nbsp;</p>

<p>As I watered the new sprouts and the trees, I noticed one of my plants really likes where it's sitting. I forgot the name of the plant, have to ask my mom again. It has beautiful flowers when it blooms.</p>

<p>I looked up at a tree we recently had trimmed back (a lot!) and saw it's sprouting its&nbsp;new branches. :D</p>
