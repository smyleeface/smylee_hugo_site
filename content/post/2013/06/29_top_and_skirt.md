<p>Between working on my brother's costume, mercury retrograde, and the upcoming trips, I hesitated to work on any new projects. But I REALLY had a sewing itch and decided to go for it.</p>    
<p>First I have brown knit fabric I brought awhile back specifically for the top in&nbsp;<a href="http://www.simplicity.com/p-2426-misses-separates.aspx" target="_blank">New Look 6735</a>. It's one of those articles of clothing that you want one in every color. In my case I'm able to get both a long (well 3/4 sleeve)&nbsp;and short sleeve version with just 1.25 yards of fabric, granted the pieces&nbsp;are&nbsp;cut just right. I didn't take any pictures during cutting&nbsp;and I should've because I forgot the layout of the pattern to maximize the fabric, so I figured it out as I went. I did mess up, but was able to recover just fine.</p>    
<p>I get very very parinoid at the fit when making things for myself. I will try it on after every major addition. Even if I try it on and pin it, I never believe the pins, and always find that I should've. For this top,&nbsp;I was ok with the fit the first try.</p>    
<p><img alt="Brown fabric pinned onto dressform." src="https://cdn.smylee.com/images/2013/07/2013-06-28_18-03-20_856_zps5cb91da0.jpg" title="Testing out the fit before I sew; I hate taking stitches out." /></p>    
<p>It took&nbsp;me about three hours to finish this top. Not too bad as I've made this top twice already. I bought a double needle to use with my walking foot (LOVE, LOVE, LOVE my walking foot - a must for knits) but everytime I go to use it, I realize I need another spool of thread - duh! So I just go through the machine twice.</p>

<p>Next was the skirt. I have a lot of fabric, but the wrong type of fabric for the skirt I want. So I decided that with the stiffer fabric I should make the skirt pleated rather than gathered and it might droop better. Also, the fabric I decided to use has a very distinct pattern to it. So I measured out each heart and based the cut off of that and the size of my waist.</p>    
<p><img alt="Pleated pink, blue, and brown heart skirt with unfinished waistband" src="https://cdn.smylee.com/images/2013/07/2013-06-29_01-57-02_632_zps4c2b1454.jpg" title="We need to match the pattern when adding the waistband." /></p>    
<p>I've come to love installing invisible zippers. I did install it a bit too low, but I'll get better with practice.</p>    
<p><img alt="Close up of needle stitching the zipper onto the dress." src="https://cdn.smylee.com/images/2013/07/2013-06-29_21-19-29_648_zps91d50a10.jpg" title="I have fallen in love with invisible zippers. So easy to put on too!" /></p>    
<p>I didn't take many progress pictures for this either, and my patterns didn't match exactly but that's ok!</p>    
<p><img alt="Close up of matching fabric pattern at the zipper." src="https://cdn.smylee.com/images/2013/07/2013-06-29_21-28-13_898_zpsadf05b2a.jpg" title="You can see my markings - it&amp;#039;s chalk so it&amp;#039;ll go away eventually...I always forget to use my disappearing ink marker." /></p>    
<p>The BIG mistake I did make, was not leaving enough seam allowance in the back, so the length of the front and back was the same. I should know better! Since I already cut the seam allowance, I re-finished the edge with the most minimum seam allowance possible.</p>    
<p><img alt="Showing the difference in seam allowance for the hem." src="https://cdn.smylee.com/images/2013/09/pink-and-blue-heart-seam-folds.jpg" title="You can see the fold for the front is larger than the back. Oops!" /></p>    
<p>I think it came out alright. I can wear the top with another skirt &nbsp;(<span style="line-height: 1.6em;">I haven't worn yet because&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 1.6em;">no top to go with it). The best part of this is</span><span style="line-height: 1.6em;">&nbsp;I got both peices complete and during mecury retrograde.</span></p>    
<p><span style="line-height: 1.6em;">That was well enough to fix my sewing itch until the July&nbsp;festivies are complete next month. :)</span></p>    <hr />  
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong></p>    
<p>I wore the outfit to neices birthday party in August. Funny, right when I got out of the car, the first thing that happens is a gust of wind made my skirt flying up and I had to wedge it between my legs for a little bit. HAHA!</p>    
<p>I asked Raul's cousin CJ to take my picture. As he was taking it, I was thinking why is he holding the camera so high up? I find out later that it's because&nbsp;higher up the camera is propped, the thinner you look...?</p>    
<p><span style="line-height: 1.6em;">Well,&nbsp;I&nbsp;felt taller in this outfit but</span>&nbsp;I LOOK SHORTER!!&nbsp;<span style="line-height: 1.6em;">:[</span></p>
