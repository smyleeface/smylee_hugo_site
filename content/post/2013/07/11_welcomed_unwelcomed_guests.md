<p>While hanging out in the backyard, I notice apple is barking at a hanging planter next to the backdoor.</p>

<p>So I go over and see what it is...? Apple is slippin!&nbsp;Turns out a dove has decided to make my planter it's nest.</p>

<p>And what's that next to it...? Awww! A baby birdie!</p>

<p>Two baby birds! And they are so big! How did we not see this? Had to be there for at least a month.</p>

<p>It's not too surprising there's a bird nest in the backyard as the doves come back every year and post up under our patio. They always make a mess with their poo so we bought these <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000KGYXGQ" target="_blank">bird deflectors</a> which actually work really well.</p>    
<p>If they succeed in&nbsp;making a nest and lay eggs,&nbsp;I let them take it's course. This year, I caught them in the act of making the nest and replaced all our deflectors. It worked as&nbsp;the barely finished&nbsp;nest was abandoned. I guess the hanging planter is where they ended up.&nbsp;Surprisingly they didn't make a mess...well, if they did it ended up all in the planter and the grass below it.</p>

<p>They day we were scheduled to leave for Vegas, they were no longer in the planter, but up in the power lines learning to fly. It was bittersweet, but I was glad I saw them flying around before we left for the week.</p>    
<p><span style="line-height: 1.6em;">I absolutely loved that they were within arms reach. If only I could pet them. :p Until next year little sneaky birdies; I'll be keeping a lookout at&nbsp;the planter now. ;)</span></p>
