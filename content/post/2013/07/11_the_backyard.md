<p>It's the end of summer, and so the zuchinni as well. They had a decent run considering the soil was mostly clay.&nbsp;It produced a few large veggies as well as a lot of smaller ones that started rotting before I could pick them. I'll probably take them out at the end of the month.</p>    
<p>At one point they were sick with powdery mildew. With the power of Google,&nbsp;<a href="http://voices.yahoo.com/get-rid-white-fuzzy-spots-zucchini-plant-leaves-8762103.html?cat=32" target="_blank">I found this post</a>&nbsp;in which&nbsp;I decided to go with the baking soda &amp; soap mix. Because the spray bottle I had was half a gallon, I used 2 tsp baking soda with&nbsp;1/2 teaspoon of dish soap. After about a week of daily spray, it finally went away.</p>

<p>The tree has grown in so full that you can't even tell it was trimmed back so much.</p>

<p>And the plumeria flowers had a good run as well. Only one branch really flowered and it's probably because that branch was mostly in the sun.</p>
