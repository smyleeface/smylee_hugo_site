<p>After making my brother's&nbsp;first costume in 2008...</p>

<p>He asked if I could make <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=cless+alvein" target="_blank">Cless Alvein</a>&nbsp;for Comic Con. Sure, but the catch -&nbsp;this one has armor.</p>    
<p><span style="line-height: 1.6em;">I made the outfit quickly and has been sitting around for a couple years now. I wasn't too crazy with the idea of making armor as it takes a lot of time.&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 1.6em;">After procrastinating for years, I've finally buckled down and finished it. I also enlisted my brother's help, as it is for him after all.</span></p>    
<p>We used craft foam for the armor, but some&nbsp;pieces were too big and&nbsp;<span>I wasn't too crazy with the idea of gluing smaller&nbsp;</span>pieces together as the seam would show.&nbsp;<span>I couldn't find large sheets at the store. Luckily eBay to the rescue with a local company selling one yard sheets.</span></p>

<p>For the "buttons" we used clay shaping it into the size we needed, baking it in the oven, and using spraypaint to get the shine.</p>

<p>Some parts I didn't want fixed, like the ankles. So we used <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=office+fasteners" target="_blank">fasteners</a> covered in the clay to match the other buttons.</p>    
<p>The brown under armor (as I called it) was brown vinyl that I found in the clearance section.</p>    
<p>And I absolutely love the cape; that thing has lining! :D</p>    
<p>After working on it every Sunday for&nbsp;about two months, it is finally complete.</p>    
<p>Only two problems - the belt ended up too big and the calve covers ripped in the corners. It fit all fine before Vegas.&nbsp;I think what happened is with all the walking we've been doing the past couple weeks, he lost a bit at the waist and his calves got bigger.</p>    
<p>Despite those things, it survived the Con. As my brother said, it needs some tweaks if he decides to wear it again next year.</p>

<p>Not too bad considering I didn't have the patience to be perfect. And a shout out to my awesome mama who helped at the very end to thrwart my frustrations on the shoulder armor. :)</p>
