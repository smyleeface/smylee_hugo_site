<p>The backyard is blooming! We'll be leaving soon for a week and with Comic-Con around the corner thought I'd take some shots before the storm.</p>    
<p>The Zuchinni is doing very well, should have&nbsp;some veggies when we get back.</p>

<p>The tree is beautiful&nbsp;and I hope my neighbor enjoyed the two months with no leaves falling into their pool. Sorry!</p>

<p>And what's that? A little birdie hanging out in the tree...</p>

<p>And last, the&nbsp;plumeria will have flowers this year. I added more soil so it will be very very happy.&nbsp;The flowers from this plant are yellow and pink. I've actually had someone in the past comment on the colors as I guess it's not that common. Will post after it blooms.</p>
