<p>Raul surprised me with some gifts with a theme... The Walking Dead! :D</p>    
<p>First he got me the books with the Govenor's backstory. Then a few days later we recieved the figurines, card game, and board game... OH MY!</p>

<p>Now I want all the Pop! Vinyl Walking Dead Toys. LOL :x</p>    <hr />  
<p><strong>UPDATE 8/3/2013:</strong></p>    
<p>I finished the book&nbsp;Walking Dead Rise of the Governor. Felt like it started off slow, but about 1/3 into the book it picked up. Then at the end:&nbsp;*shok*</p>    
<p>I don't know anyone else that's read the book, so I've been keeping the end to myself. Raul needs to read it already! Started Road to Woodbury but only one chapter.</p>
