<p>I'm itchin to finish something this weekend.&nbsp;Since my dress is on hold, last minute&nbsp;I decided to make a clutch purse, specifically this one from <a href="http://www.noodle-head.com/2010/04/gathered-clutch-tutorial.html" target="_blank">noodle-head.com</a>.&nbsp;Back in September-October, I went to yardage town and came across Skelanimal fabric. Oh I was estatic! I didn't know what I was going to make with it, I just knew I had to have it.&nbsp;It was inexpensive;&nbsp;less than $5/yd. and picked up two designs.</p>

<p>I also found some buttons, while not skelanimal, matched with the design and the color of the fabric (more so than these photos show!)</p>

<p>I decided to use the white lining I found in the drawer yesterday and some black leftover lining from the dress.</p>

<p>Now that I had all the pieces, time to get to work!</p>

<p>The other day I was looking though the sewing box that attaches to the machine. Found this metal bar and learned it's&nbsp;a fabric guide. I decided to give it a try and it worked great!</p>

<p>My favorite part, winding the bobbin... *sarcasm*</p>    
<p><img alt="Gathered side of the clutch with embellishments" src="/images/2013/01/2013-01-21_20-24-28_235.jpg" title="Gathered side of the clutch with embellishments" /></p>    
<p>I didn't take many progress pictures because there wasn't that many steps. It&nbsp;took me about 2.5 hours to make since it was my first time. It didn't come out too bad.</p>    
<p><img alt="Inside the clutch, two pockets" src="/images/2013/01/2013-01-21_20-25-05_711.jpg" title="The inside of the clutch with two slots for cards or money." /></p>    
<p>The inside lining is a bit flimsy and bubbles, but it's not stiff fabric so what should I expect?&nbsp;It's nice though; I think it&nbsp;gives femininity&nbsp;to the item. :)</p>    
<p>Now I have a little bag to put my money, phone &amp; sunglasses when running to the store at lunch. :D</p>
