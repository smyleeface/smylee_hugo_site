<p>Now that I've had a little break from sewing, it's time to get on and use some of the fabric my mom gave me. :) The first dress is going to be <a href="http://www.simplicity.com/p-7919-misses-miss-petite-dresses-leanne-marshall-collection.aspx#" target="_blank">Simplicity 1755</a> View B.</p>

<p>I made the muslin awhile back but thought I'd try it on my dressform (and on myself!)&nbsp;:p</p>

<p>I've also had the fabric for awhile. I'm still not sure about the orange, might be too bright. We'll see..</p>

<p><span style="line-height: 1.6em;">Laying out the pieces, making sure I had enough fabric.&nbsp;I had the exact amount needed.</span></p>

<p>All the pieces are cut! Now on to my favorite part...putting it all together. :)</p>

<p>This fabric frayed a lot and&nbsp;because of the weave design it would sometimes come out in chunks. Yay for the serger!!&nbsp;*biggrin*&nbsp;The only part I didn't overlock is the pockets because they had a U shape to them. I cut around it with the pinking shears but that did't help too much.</p>

<p>Now as I'm trying the top on, I feel like the fabric is a bit thin. I shake it off and continue on to find I'm at&nbsp;the LINING step of the pattern! All this time, I never realized I needed lining.&nbsp;I found some white lining in my drawer but I really wanted black, so a quick run to the store and I had my lining. *good*</p>

<p>This skirt has so many pleats! I didn't do a good job making the pleats&nbsp;even. Next time&nbsp;I'll lookup and try a different technique.</p>

<p>After putting the top and bottoms together, next was the zipper. It was my first time putting on an invisible zipper.&nbsp;I don't think I did too bad thanks to this&nbsp;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzVLRsoOVzY" target="_blank">invisible zipper tutorial</a>.</p>

<p>I've tried it on and it all fits well, but after putting on the orange collar&nbsp;and sleeve, it's just too bright. I need to find a darker orange. :(</p>

<p>Swung by JoAnns and they didn't have the orange I wanted, but they had a couple shades of red to choose from.&nbsp;I think it will work out ok. :)</p>

<p>Now I have all the contrast pieces cut.</p>

<p>The process for making this slit was interesting. I messed up a couple times, it was hard to understand the instructions.</p>
<p><img alt="Slit and button loop on sleeve" src="http://cdn.smylee.com/images/2013/02/fall-colored-striped-dress-sleeve-loop.jpg" title="It was really cool to see how to make a slit like this"></a></p>
<p>I was so excited to get it all together that I didn't take anymore pictures until it was finished. :)&nbsp;I didn't think to match the front stripes when I cutout the fabric, but surprised it came out so close.</p>

<p>The back of the dress didn't come out too bad with the zipper and how the lines matched. It did pull in towards the waist.</p>

<p>It fits perfectly and I love it!&nbsp;:p</p>
