<p><span>I found this green and gold butterfly knit and I love it. But what to make with it? I have such a hard time deciding on fabric&nbsp;</span><span>with prints. </span><span>The interesting thing about this fabric is the 8" strip on one salvaged edge; which is good for contrast especially in the style I'm planning on making</span><span>.</span></p>

<p>After washing,&nbsp;drying, and ironing&nbsp;(yes a little bit!), it was time to&nbsp;cut.</p>

<p>Finally finished cutting what I thought was all the peices. I wanted to pin it on the dressform but couldn't find the front piece. I couldn't find it because the pattern&nbsp;was still in the envelope. The way I cut the fabric out, there was no way I could get one piece&nbsp;cut much less four!</p>

<p><span>Luckily the store&nbsp;had some&nbsp;(same store different location.) I also&nbsp;picked up some thread,&nbsp;all&nbsp;for under $5.</span></p>    
<p><span style="line-height: 1.6em;">Fastforwad a few days and I finished the top! I've made it before so I already had an idea of what I was doing. It's a very comforable top.</span></p>

<p>I really want to wear it with some leggings, but don't have any. I'll post a picture of me in it later.</p>
