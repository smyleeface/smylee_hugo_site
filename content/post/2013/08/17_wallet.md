<p>A while back I purchased a yard of four types of <a href="http://skelanimals.com/" target="_blank">Skelanimal</a> fabric. I didn't know what I was going to do with it, and apparel wasn't really appealling. I've decided that purses and bags are a good use for them.</p>    
<p>My first use of the Skelanimal fabric was the gathered clutch. This time I decided to try my hand at a wallet.</p>    
<p>Of course the supplies. (I love first photos of just the supplies; it's just so amazing to see a pile of stuff turn into something.)</p>    
<p><img alt="Cut fabric and interfacing, zipper, and bias tape laying on the table." src="/images/2013/09/2013-07-29_14-23-48_807.jpg" title="All the pieces are cut and ready to be assembled..." /></p>    
<p>Because the Skelanimal fabric is a one way design, I had to cut the fabric&nbsp;in half and flip it around and restitch. This way when the wallet is folded, the pattern will not be upside down. So the seam is not so obvious, I finished it off with some single fold bias tape.</p>    
<p><img alt="Close up of binding tape used to hide the seam." src="/images/2013/09/2013-07-29_14-51-45_620.jpg" title="Clean stitches!" /></p>    
<p>To reinforce the seam, I added a strip of interfacing on the back. I was trying to make the "fold" a little bit thicker.</p>    
<p><img alt="Two pieces of fabric with an interfacing strip in the middle." src="/images/2013/09/2013-07-29_14-58-34_282.jpg" title="Giving a little support." /></p>    
<p>Then I started on the card pockets. I added a single layer of interfacing for each pocket.</p>    
<p><img alt="Fabric with interfacing ironed on." src="/images/2013/09/2013-07-29_15-15-52_171.jpg" title="Pockets were the easiest to make." /></p>    
<p>After adding the interfacing and pressing, I cacaded the pockets and&nbsp;attached it to the inside fabric of the wallet.</p>    
<p><img alt="Layers of fabric sewn together to create pockets." src="/images/2013/09/2013-07-29_15-39-17_992.jpg" title="I used a credit card to make sure it was wide enough." /></p>    
<p>Then I whipped up the zipper pocket and attached that to the inside fabric of the wallet opposite the card pockets.&nbsp;OH! and I put the zipper pocket on upside down. HAHA!&nbsp;*pardon*&nbsp;</p>    
<p><img alt="Folded fabric which shows the back and the front of the attached zipper." src="/images/2013/09/2013-07-29_16-19-41_971.jpg" title="I never knew creating zipper pockets would be so easy." /></p>    
<p>I love finishing edges with bias tape. For some reason, it's so much easier than folding over seam allowance.&nbsp;The downside is handstitching the other side of the bias tape. Now, I don't have to handstitch because bias tape is folded so you can "stitch&nbsp;the ditch" but catch the tape&nbsp;on the other side. Well, that doesn't always work out well for me as some parts will slip out of place and miss the needle. I ABSOLUTELY HATE removing stiches and would rather spend the extra time handstitching than removing them.</p>    
<p>I forgot to take pictures&nbsp;and I remembered as I was finishing up the hand stitching.</p>

<p><span style="line-height: 1.6em;">After adding the bias tape&nbsp;that it was it! The one step I didn't include in here is the craft foam I added to each flap (you can see the foam&nbsp;in the supplies photo.)</span></p>    
<p><img alt="Opened wallet showing the different pockets and slots" src="/images/2013/09/2013-07-29_18-43-42_977.jpg" title="So much room for things! There's even a little key chain tab, awwww." /></p>    
<p>After it was finished, I felt it was a little too large and that I needed to put a lot in it to bulk it up.</p>    
<p><img alt="Folded Skelanimal printed wallet" src="/images/2013/09/finished-skelanimal-wallet.jpg" title="All done!" /></p>    
<p>I have tons of cards and I stuff all the reciepts in there so it didn't take long to thicken up. My phone fit nicely as well. I learned a lot from this "test" (as I've told everyone) and I've read a bit about interfacing so my next bag project will be a little different.</p>
