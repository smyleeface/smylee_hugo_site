<p>We decided to have Chipotle&nbsp;and ordered online. They ask for the name of the person the order is for so it's easy to divide up when returning home. I decided to add a different emote to each name.</p>

<p>Haha! And you know I must&nbsp;have my chips! :p&nbsp;When I got home to my surprised, they added the emotes! :D</p>
