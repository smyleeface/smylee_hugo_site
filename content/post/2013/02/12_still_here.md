<p>Still here just haven't worked on anything crafty since MLK weekend. My craft room temporarily turned into a drying room after laundry day(s) and because it's so cold, it took a couple days for the clothes to dry. Anyway, I'm thrilled that there's a three-day weekend coming up which means I need to finish the dress and make something else. I'm probably going to make the little bag my mom was asking me to make months ago.</p>    
<p>I did however, attend the local DrupalCamp (aka <a href="http://sandcamp.org" target="_blank">SandCamp</a>) the weekend after MLK day, and took a training for Android app development with Drupal as the back-end. Last week I took that tutorial and was able to recreate it but using this site. I currently have an app installed on my phone that pulls the titles of my posts. Umm... that's all it does at the moment... :) My next step is to make those titles links so it pulls up the article. I'm a bit stuck at the moment as this site's Drupal is not quite working the way I want it yet, so on one hand I don't want to post too much. I'll have to go back and fix everything, but on the other hand if I wait, the site may never see the light of day once again. So for now I'll just post.</p>    
<p>Also I'm trying to learn the guitar so I can play along with Raul. I'm SUPER beginner, and started playing <a href="http://rocksmith.ubi.com/rocksmith/en-us/home/index.aspx" target="_blank">Rocksmith</a>. It's pretty cool, but my fingertips are so sore and burn when I wash my hands right now.&nbsp;I played almost all day this past Saturday!&nbsp;I took a day off to let them rest a bit, but I can't go too long if I want them to callus. So that's what I'm up to at the moment. Until next time... :D</p>
