<p>Every Valentines day we make filet minion with asparagus, and sometimes rice, but try to have potatoes. This year since it fell on a Thursday, we decided&nbsp;to wait until Friday so we could relax and enjoy the night. I decided to make onion soup as well.</p>

<p>I actually used a combination of two different recipes, even though there really isn't much to begin with. The addition of thyme and the slice of french bread was so amazingly good. :9</p>    
<p>The table was still a bit dirty and we were so hungry after work that we just wanted to eat. I hate to link the photo. :x lol</p>

<p>We ate the soup prior to sitting down to eat.&nbsp;Everything was&nbsp;delicious! :)</p>
