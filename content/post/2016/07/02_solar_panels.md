My solar panels are finally up and running! They've been up for about 2 months now but there was always something that needed to be adjusted or inspected. I signed the paper work on January 26, SIX months ago! It should've been on two-three months ago, but paperwork was messed up and they didn't include the new electric panel on the initial install. Then I was waiting for inspection, turns out, they were waiting for word on some work that was already completely a month an a half before I called to follow up! Anyway, at least they are finally done and I am grandfathered into the original <a href="http://www.sdge.com/clean-energy/overview/overview" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Net Metering</a>.

I received a profile to monitor the generation of the panels and in the settings saw there was API access...

API ACCESS!?! WOO! Of course I wanted to add it to my site. Took about a day to get it all connected and working and you can find more about <a href="/smylee/solar_data/">my solar generation</a> and how <a href="/post/2016/07/02_solar_api_setup/">I set up the API</a>.
