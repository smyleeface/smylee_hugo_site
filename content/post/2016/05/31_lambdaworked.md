# My Site is Now Using Lambda!!

Attempting to revive my site after letting it go again. Drupal was too heavy for what I wanted to do with it. Robert told me about [Hugo Static Site Generator](https://gohugo.io/) and it's very easy to use and lightweight.

I'm stoked that the site is finally up and running. All I have to do is make these simple markdown page and upload to an S3 bucket. A plain HTML only site - are we back in 1998? NOPE not with HUGO!

Time to take a break, but I had to make another post because it's so fun to watch it update. :)

Lots of clean up, additional features to add, and uploading to github but it's working!!!
