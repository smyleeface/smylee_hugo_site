My costume this year was a [La Calavera Catrina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Calavera_Catrina).

My mom invited me her friend's painting party that was theme d√≠a de muertos and figured that would be my costume this year.

The costume was pretty simple, I had the skirt and belt already and made the blouse to match.
I also made the headband and belt "buckle" with lots and lots of glue. :stuck_out_tongue:
Makeup design was was taken from a sticker that Raul has on our mini fridge.

We  and we learned to paint this awesome picture. It was a lot of fun.

I also used this costume for dressing up at work that won me $35 @ Target. The makeup was a little different but still 45 min of work put into it.
