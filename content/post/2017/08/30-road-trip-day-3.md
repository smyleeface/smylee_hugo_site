Having about 5 hours to drive, we arrive at Yellowstone around 4-5. The place I reserved a car is not in service and I need to go to the airport to get one. So we find another car rental and all they have is a Jeep that's almost $200 a day. It was totally worth it though. So much easier to manage the stuff we brought. I was just worried if a bear came and scratch up the car! Luckily that did not happen.

We get to the Madison campground, pitch the tent, and get a fire going while cooking dinner over the open flame. A neighbor joins us later in the evening then we all call it a night.

It's at this point I've been without internet for 8 hours and will not have any for the next 2 days, I love it. I even put my phone on airplane mode to save battery (I didn't know my roaming voice and text was free until later.)
