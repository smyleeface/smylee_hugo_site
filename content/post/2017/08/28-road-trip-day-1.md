It's finally here! The road trip that was booked a little over a month ago. We left a little late having to go back for things, but finally got on our way around 7pm.

We finally got to [Oasis Las Vegas RV Resort](http://www.oasislasvegasrvresort.com/) around 11pm. We're all pooped for the day with our things just thrown into any open spot, making it hard to find what we need.

This place had the best bathrooms of the trip. Clean, large, private room w/sink, toilet and shower. The one I picked had little hot water but it was still the best shower room.

There was no easy access to the dog park and it was all gravel. My dogs sniffed the area but were not interested in running around.
