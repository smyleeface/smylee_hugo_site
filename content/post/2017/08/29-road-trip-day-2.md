We spend the morning organizing our things in the RV and leave a little late. I decide to skip out on Zion as it was a 2 hours in/out drive for a 30m-1hr walk. That extra 3 hours would get us to the next stop around 10 or 11 again. Zion is about 10hr from me, I could plan it for a long weekend.

Lagoon campground is attached to the park that was closed for the off season, which was the best thing! We wouldn't have time for the park anyway. The campground had about 3 campers including us. We arrive around 7ish and it was like having the whole RV park to ourselves. The bathrooms were good and clean.

I knew there was a trail nearby, and kinda wanted to go in the dark but never having gone on it we don't of course. Come to find the next day, it's a paved trail and I would've totally gone. :x
