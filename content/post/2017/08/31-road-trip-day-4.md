We eat Ramen and eggs for breakfast and head out around 9. Old Faithful is the first stop as it is the most attractive to tourists. On our way out we by firewood and the couple who let us cut them, allowed us to get to Old Faithful 5 min before eruption.

Once it was done we continued on the loop.

We stop at Kaskade Falls, that will give Vertigo to the best of them, but beautiful nonetheless.

Another stop to find a trail to hike has signs posted "Bears know to frequent this area. The trail head is a cave of tree branches and is very sketchy. We nope out of there to the next one.

Delacy Trail a 3mi hike to Shoeshine Lake. Fairly flat and very easy hike, will still shortly leave you breathless if not used to the altitude.

On our way back we swear we heard growling not once but twice. We looked at each other and banged our sticks, talking loudly, while continuing our way out.

We stopped at a couple viewpoints with animals and scenery. Lots of waterfalls and rapids. Bubbling water burping of sulfur. What was funny is it was chilly about 55, started raining on the south east side of yellowstone. When we got back to our campsite around 6 it was mid 70s, people swimming in the lake.

- Note for next time: place to swim!

After sighseeing around Yellowstone, we go back to camp and make dinner. The steak is juicy and the menudo is yummy.

Another neighbor joins us and stay till around 12:30a. We have to wait for the fire to burn out and we go to bed around 2am!
