It's my birthday, and I keep forgetting!

We get up early to pack up so we can have time to shower at the park. The bathrooms are good and clean just like Lagoons. This is the first time we need a code for the bathroom.

It's a long day of driving over 8 hours. We get to the park and it's very nice also with large private clean bathrooms. I would say this place had the second best bathrooms. We keep taking the wrong turn back from the bathrooms though.
